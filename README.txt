Gameplay:
Change directions to increase your charge slowdown! Keep moving or your
slowdown amount will quickly decrease! When your charge reaches a mark that
your slowdown amount is below, you'll automatically fire. If you fire and
you're not able to hit an enemy, you lose! Make sure to prevent yourself from
firing until you have a high enough charge to deal with the enemies in front
of you! Explained better in game.
